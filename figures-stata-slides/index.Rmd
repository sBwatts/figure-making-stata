# Why should you care?

--

- The more you can do in one software the better!

--

    - **Efficient workflows** are everything
    
--

- Point and click graphics are so 2008 (see Black Eyed Peas, 2009)

--

- Repeatability and reproducibility

--

    - Isn’t it so fun having to redo a figure you created time and time again, starting from the beginning each time?
    
--

- Being able to present data/findings through effective visualizations is a powerful skill

# The power of data visualization

- Enhanced interpretation

  - Tables can sometimes be hard to interpret

- Engagement 

  - Your audience is likely going to appreciate an effective visual instead of a table – especially policy-makers and practitioners!

---

## Don't you want to make cool figures like this?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height = "100%", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("combined-plot.jpg")
```

# Let's walk through some code

- Visit my Github repository: https://github.com/sBwatts/figure-making-stata

  - See “figure-making-stata.do”

  - Note: I consider this a work in progress and will update/add to it

- *Shameless plug* – If you are interested in how to make wonderful tables in Stata see my “table-making-stata” repository on Github for some tips: https://github.com/sBwatts/table-making-stata
